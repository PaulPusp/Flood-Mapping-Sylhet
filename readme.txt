# Flood Mapping on the Sylhet-Shillong Plateau using Google Earth Engine

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on flood mapping on the Sylhet-Shillong Plateau using Google Earth Engine. The project aims to detect floods, analyze rainfall deviation, and estimate runoff in the region.

## Project Structure

- **/code**: Contains the Google Earth Engine code for flood mapping, rainfall deviation analysis, and runoff estimation.
- **/data**: Includes sample data used in the project, such as satellite imagery, rainfall data, and hydrological information.
- **/results**: Stores the generated maps and visualizations, showcasing flood detection, rainfall deviation, and runoff estimation.


3. Open the Google Earth Engine code files using the Earth Engine JavaScript Code Editor or any text editor of your choice.

4. Modify the code as needed, adjusting parameters, regions of interest, and data sources.

5. Run the code in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor or using the Earth Engine API.

6. Explore the results in the `/results` directory and use them for further analysis or reporting.
